Following a talking White Rabbit, she falls a long way down a rabbit-hole only to find herself in a dreamlike fantasy world. Running into some of the most entertaining characters in English literature—The White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Mock Turtle, the Cheshire Cat and the King and Queen of Hearts—and being variously mistaken for a housemaid, a serpent, a volcano, a flower and a monster, all in the breath of a single afternoon, Alice is left intrigued and bewildered in equal measure. If this is a magical world, where anything can happen, how will Alice ever find her way back home?Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, a whimsically inventive tale, still enchants the readers regardless of their age, with its exceptionally conjured up nonsense dream world and deliciously mad dialogues. It has been adapted into various television series and numerous films. with an enormously influential narrative course, structure, characters and imagery, it continues to influence and inspire many other works of art even a hundred and fifty years after it was first written.",

On November 20, 1820, the whaleship Essex was rammed and sunk by an angry whale.  Within minutes, the twenty-one-man crew, including the fourteen-year-old cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, found themselves stranded in three leaky boats in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with barely any supplies and little hope.  Three months later, two of the boats were rescued 4,500 miles away, off the coast of South America.  Of the twenty-one castaways, only eight survived, including young Thomas.  Based on his New York Times best-seller In the Heart of the Sea, Nathaniel Philbrick recreates the amazing events of the ill-fated Essex through the sailors own first-hand accounts, photos, maps, and artwork, and tells the tale of one of the great true-life adventure stories.",

Malone agrees to accompany Challenger, as well as Challenger's unconvinced colleague Professor Summerlee, and the adventurer Lord John Roxton, into the wilds of South America and the Amazon in search of Challenger's fantastical beasts. There, cut off from the rest of civilization and high atop an isolated plateau, the explorers find themselves in an amazing land of extinct dinosaurs, a native tribe, and a group of ape-like creatures. The party is drawn into a violent battle when they are taken captive by the ape men and must use their cunning and resourcefulness to escape and save the lives of their party and the other captured native tribesmen.
