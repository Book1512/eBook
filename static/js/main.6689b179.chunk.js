When a cat belonging to his daughter was killed on the busy truck route in front of his house, King wondered: what would happen if he buried the cat, and three days later it came back, somewhat altered? And what if a child were killed, too, then came back changed (and not for the better)? In the novel, doctor Louis Creed takes a job at the University of Maine Infirmary and moves his wife, daughter and two-year-old son Gage into a house by a busy interstate. The highway soon consumes his daughter\u2019s cat and later his son. But the permanency of death is a hard lesson for a parent to learn, and when Creed interferes with the natural order, fate slams him tenfold with retribution.

Fighting the actual evil of It is a much trickier proposition, one that depends upon a perfect blend of mysticism and childhood faith necessary to overcome It\u2019s greatest weapons: fear and entropy, and the ability to make an entire town forget about the atrocities it commits and allows.

Further, there is information on what you may be experiencing physically, from being exhausted and having to constantly pee to feeling nauseous and constipated all in the same day, again reassuring you that this is perfectly normal.The goal of this book is to provide you with the information you need to conduct a safe and healthy pregnant environment for your baby to grow and develop in.

Multi-homing consists in connecting a network to the Internet at different access points. As traffic leaves and enters the network through several access links, multi-homed networks need to control their traffic, also called traffic engineering. Multi-homed networks typically perform traffic engineering by tweaking the BGP routing protocol. The purpose of BGP is to distribute the information about reachable networks across the whole Internet, not to perform traffic engineering. It is thus important for multi-homed networks to know the complexity of traffic engineering with BGP. In this book, we explain how BGP can be used to engineer the traffic and what can be expected from doing it. The content of this book targets two types of readers. First, the network managers of small to medium-size stub networks will better understand BGP and how to use it to engineer their traffic. Second, researchers in networking will learn about three different research areas: Internet traffic characteristics, interdomain routing, and evolutionary optimization.",link:"https://online.fliphtml5.com/fxqlq/wgsn/"},{id:7,name:"iOS App Reverse Engineering",image:"https://previews.dropbox.com/p/thumb/ABrzTTDnziEyeag_nvnmZKHdyW1VaMIbYTQcyGXWs_eJpJAT9x1jcxygUon09GHkt_AOnBFjoY_8apEf7hu4wM_ADzxrqBOpxVlY1P2nFhKK2ZX_a28f-HJz4aLTO7T_MiNeLN6QxGxFyPHzsClaM9gqvB1EQF6Q1MoCS0hJhC3FfGTJXRob0_fVarmWqbARfbapkO1EoWRFLrYVbNa22IkzksRSMLKlsTYWtL53du7dC4w2WhcUJYByae5H8097E2883BPqVw4Zse7IxP7iaaAP5bdgJcpXLOenJwy5GTmE1FyC92j5TDJjDzsbEmWfavFEkx8oOJRcI2hhTCot_oD6MOnSyUZ6eUB26DSVlMXhRPtUW87zYk_bgfTvGvw6tXI/p.jpeg",des:"Reverse engineering is the direct opposite of building or engineering an application: you break things down bit by bit to see how they actually work.

In the midst of these rough conditions, and the violence of apartheid South Africa, Musk still thrived academically and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he paid his own way through school by turning his house into a club and throwing massive parties.He started a pair of huge dot-com successes, including PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002.

Just as the most effective weight loss strategy is to limit portions by using smaller plates, Michalowicz shows that by taking profit first and apportioning only what remains for expenses, entrepreneurs will transform their businesses from cash-eating monsters to profitable cash cows.

Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states:Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life! Eker does this by identifying your money and success blueprint. We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money\u2014and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and revise it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen Wealth Files, which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book.

White shows us Lincoln as a man who would leave a trail of thoughts in his wake, jotting ideas on scraps of paper and filing them in his top hat or the bottom drawer of his desk; a country lawyer who asked questions in order to figure out his own thinking on an issue, as much as to argue the case; a hands-on commander in chief who, as soldiers and sailors watched in amazement, commandeered a boat and ordered an attack on Confederate shore batteries at the tip of the Virginia peninsula; a man who struggled with the immorality of slavery and as president acted publicly and privately to outlaw it forever; and finally, a president involved in a religious odyssey who wrote, for his own eyes only, a profound meditation on \u201cthe will of God\u201d in the Civil War that would become the basis of his finest address.
